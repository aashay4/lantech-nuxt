          <h1>How to Improve Website Page Loading Speed?</h1>
          <hr>

<p>Ever since Google launched the page experience update, a website's page loading speed has become crucial to rank a website in Google SERP. As a matter of fact, many website owners are struggling to improve their website's page loading speed. Even for a WordPress website, it has become difficult to make a website SEO-friendly by improving page loading speed.</p>
<p>Having a fast page loading speed helps website owners to not only rank higher in the search engine but also improve the user experience. For example, consider two websites. One with the faster page loading speed and another website with the same information with the slow page loading speed. In this situation, which website would you prefer? A website with a faster page loading speed, right? if you are a service provider then it helps in getting more customers and in case you are an eCommerce website owner then it helps your website to sell more products.</p>
<h2>Different ways to improve a website's page loading speed:</h2>
<h3>Make Sure your content is rendered properly the search engines:</h3>
<p>Many of the Javascript developers complain about the content rendering of their Javascript website developed with Angular, React, or Vue.js. If your website is also developed with such a framework then make sure search engines are not finding it difficult to read the content on your website. You can perform pre-rendering or server-side rendering techniques to rendering your website's content properly. If you do not want to use such frameworks then you can directly use a server-side rendering framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js.</p>
<h3>Compress Files</h3>
<p>Compressing various Javascript, CSS, and HTML files can help you to reduce the size of your page. Make sure your website's size should not be more than 150 bytes. Compressing images with the help of Photoshop does not impact the quality of the image. So, you can prefer compressing big images for a faster page loading speed.</p>
<h3>Improve server response time</h3>
<p>Many website owners face server response time issues when they use shared hosting or bad hosting. Traffic may also be an issue with server response time. To get over this issue, you need to make sure that you use a good web server. Digitalocean and AWS are good solutions if you are facing a server response time issue.</p>
<h3>Optimize Ads Design</h3>
<p>First of all, Good AdSense's script makes the website's page loading speed slow. Along with that, Google Adsense is also responsible for higher Cumulative Layout Shifts. A Cumulative Layout Shift is a really important factor to pass the page experience test. You can optimize the ad by updating the CSS file and allocating special division to the ad.</p>
<h3>Reduce Redirects</h3>
<p>Sending multiple redirect requests to the server can increase the page loading speed for your website. You should avoid redirecting your web pages from HTTP to HTTPS and other domains. Along with that, encapsulating data in one variable and then sending it to the server is a good option rather than sending multiple requests to the server. This can improve page loading speed by a few milliseconds.</p>
<h3>Minify Javascript and CSS Files</h3>
<p>A website might have hundreds of CSS and Javascript files. In this case, if you minify these files, it can improve the page loading speed by reducing the load on a server.</p>
